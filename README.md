Installation
To run this code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy tensorflow matplotlib
Usage
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python <script-name>.py
The script will train the PINN model and produce plots of the diffusion solution at a fixed time, along with an animation showing the evolution of the solution over time.

Code Overview
Model Architecture
The model is defined using the PINN class, which inherits from tf.keras.Model. The architecture consists of:

Two hidden layers with 20 neurons each and tanh activation functions.
An output layer that provides the predicted value 
𝑢
(
𝑥
,
𝑡
)
u(x,t), representing the diffusion process.

Copy code
class PINN(tf.keras.Model):

Loss Functions
The loss function is composed of three components:

PDE Loss: Measures the residual of the diffusion PDE.
Boundary Loss: Ensures that boundary conditions are satisfied.
Initial Loss: Enforces initial conditions based on the diffusion process.
The total loss is computed as follows:

python
Copy code
def compute_loss(...):
    ...
Training Procedure
The training process involves defining an optimizer with a learning rate schedule and a training loop that runs for a specified number of epochs. During each epoch, the gradients are calculated, and the model weights are updated to minimize the total loss.

python
Copy code
def train_pinn(epochs=100):
    ...
Visualization
Two visualization functions are included:

Plotting for a Fixed Time: Displays the model's prediction of diffusion at a specified time 
𝑡
t.

python
Copy code
def plot_fixed_time(model, t_val):
    ...
Animation of Solution Over Time: Creates an animated GIF showing how the diffusion solution evolves as time progresses.

Diffusion PDE and Its Applications in Plant Science
The diffusion partial differential equation (PDE) describes how substances such as nutrients, water, and gases spread out over time within a medium. The most common form of the diffusion equation in one dimension is:

∂
𝑢
(
𝑥
,
𝑡
)
∂

𝐷
∂

∂

where:

𝑢
(
𝑥

)
u(x,t) is the concentration of the diffusing substance at position 
𝑥
x and time 
𝑡
t,
𝐷
D is the diffusion coefficient, which quantifies how fast the substance diffuses through the medium,
𝑓
(
𝑥

𝑡
)
f(x,t) is an external source term representing additional sources or sinks of the substance in the system.
Applications in Plant Science
Nutrient Uptake:

The diffusion PDE can model how nutrients move through soil and into plant roots, helping to optimize fertilizer application and improve plant growth.
Water Movement:

Water diffusion through plant tissues (e.g., leaves, stems) can be described using diffusion equations, crucial for studying transpiration and irrigation practices.
Gas Exchange:

The diffusion of gases (such as oxygen and carbon dioxide) within plant tissues is vital for processes like photosynthesis and respiration.
Pesticide and Herbicide Application:

The diffusion of chemical substances like pesticides in soil and plant tissues can be modeled to assess the effectiveness and environmental impact of these chemicals.
Disease Spread:

Plant diseases can spread through diffusion of pathogens in the soil or within plant tissues, helping to develop strategies for disease management.
In summary, the diffusion PDE serves as a fundamental tool in plant science for modeling various processes related to the movement of substances, providing insights that can enhance agricultural practices and plant health.

Full Diffusion Equation
In the current implementation, we choose the external source term 
𝑓
(
𝑥
,
𝑡
)
=
0
f(x,t)=0. This simplifies the equation to:

∂
𝑢
(
𝑥
,
𝑡
)
∂
𝑡
=
𝐷
∂

By setting 
𝑓
(
𝑥
,
𝑡
)
=
0
f(x,t)=0, we focus on the natural diffusion process without any external influences, allowing us to analyze the fundamental behavior of the diffusion process.

Chosen Boundary and Initial Conditions
Boundary Conditions
In this model, we define boundary conditions that can represent the physical constraints of the system. The boundary conditions are set such that:

At the left boundary 
𝑢
(
0
,
𝑡
)
=
0
u(0,t)=0: The concentration at position 
𝑥
=
0
x=0 is fixed at 0.
At the right boundary 
𝑢
(
1
,
𝑡
)
=
0
u(1,t)=0: The concentration at position 
𝑥
=
1
x=1 is also fixed at 0.
These conditions may represent scenarios where the substance cannot enter or leave the system at the boundaries, simulating a closed environment.

Initial Conditions
The initial condition is set as:

𝑢
(
𝑥
,
0
)
=
sin
⁡
(
𝜋
𝑥
)
u(x,0)=sin(πx)
This choice provides an initial distribution of the diffusing substance, simulating a sinusoidal concentration profile along the spatial domain. The use of this initial condition helps to visualize how the diffusion process evolves over time.

Example Data
The script includes example data for training, which consists of random samples for spatial and temporal domains, along with initial and boundary conditions based on a sinusoidal function. This simulates the diffusion behavior typical in plant systems.
